This project analyzes the data given to come up with recommendations for a new movie division for Microsoft.

Business Problem
Microsoft is looking to open and new movie division and is asking us to make recommendations for movies.
I will make recommendations on
1.) Production budget
2.) Release months
3.) Targeted genres
4.) Ratings and total gross
5.) Suggested writers

Data
The data comes from 
https://www.themoviedb.org 1930 to 2020
https://www.the-numbers.com  1975 to 2016
https://www.imdb.com 2010 to 2022
https://www.boxofficemojo.com 2010 to 2018


Methods
this project uses descriptive analysis, including aggregate functions to show averages of different datasets.
This shows an overview of returns we can expect based off the averages of other movies that have released in the past.


Results

We want to have a larger production budget; the data shows that generally larger production budgets will have a higher overall gross and profit. I suggest a 300 million to 400 million dollar production budget. Due to the fact that only 2 movies had over 400 million it is hard to tell if the average profit will remain high.
May, June, July, November, and December should be our target release months.  Movies released during these months have the highest returns, and the holiday month of December is particularly promising due to the lack of competition with other new releases.
Documentary,  Animation, History,  Biography, and War are genres with compelling opportunities due to the fact they generate high ratings and high revenue.
When targeting those top genres, we should reach out to the top rated writers in that category.
